# PortfolioProject

This is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack project that demonstrates a basic implementation of a web application.

## Overview

The MERN stack is a popular combination of technologies used for building full-stack web applications. It consists of the following components:

- MongoDB: A NoSQL database that stores application data in a flexible, JSON-like format.
- Express.js: A web application framework for building robust and scalable server-side applications.
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows running JavaScript on the server-side.

This project showcases the integration of these technologies to create a simple web application with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.

## Functionality

The MERN stack project provides the following features:

- User registration and authentication
- Management of user profiles and data
- CRUD operations on data entities
- Basic routing and navigation
- Integration with a MongoDB database
